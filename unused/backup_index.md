## Notes 

Created a page at [See the cannabinoids](cannabinoids.html)

Note to self:
[this blog post](http://jmcglone.com/guides/github-pages/) has a simple introductory example

Note to self:
[this blog post](http://joshualande.com/create-tables-sql) has a short intro to creating an SQL table, although I will probably just use long format CSV since the table won't be that big.
