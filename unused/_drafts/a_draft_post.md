# Projecting euclidean distance matrices into 2d space

This post implements (in Python) a simple but cool example of determing real coordinates from a Euclidean distance matrix. In particular: determining the location of Swiss cities from the matrix of pairwise train times between them. The original idea was found in a [really nice paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1502.07541) with DOI: 10.1109/MSP.2015.2398954
